# morsecode.fun
Ditching the repo "MorseCodeFun" (without the dot) which was made in PHP and was VERY unfinished. Consider this one as the better "rewritten" version made with Flask.

# Reporting Issues
This repo will only be used in order to let users report issues of my app 'morsecode.fun'. The app will not be open-source for now.
